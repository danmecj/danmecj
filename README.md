- 👋 Hey, I’m Danial! I'm a 2nd year student studying Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) and look forward to making full use of this platform (since I've been putting it off for so long).
- 👀 I’m passionate about education and the access it provides to almost everyone around the world 🌏 .
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (numpy, tf, scikit, openCV), Flutter & Dart to occupy my free time.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations on my LinkedIn or shoot me an email: danialmecja@gmail.com
